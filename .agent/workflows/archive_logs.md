description: Archive completed and cancelled items to keep active logs lean.

1.  **Identify Destination:**
    *   Work Log (`log/CH/work_log_2026.md`) -> `log/CH/work_log_archive_2026.md`
    *   Personal Log (`log/Personal/personal_log_2026.md`) -> `log/Personal/personal_log_archive_2026.md`

2.  **Scan for Items:**
    *   Look for the `#### Done` section in each project within the active log files.
    *   Identify all items marked as `✅ **[DONE]**` or `❌ **[CANCELLED]**`.

3.  **Transfer:**
    *   **Cut** the completed/cancelled items from the active log.
    *   **Paste** them into the corresponding Archive file.
    *   *Formatting Rule:* Ensure the Archive file maintains a structure that groups items by Project, similar to the active log, or appends them to existing Project headers in the archive. If a Project header doesn't exist in the archive, create it.

4.  **Verification:**
    *   Ensure no active tasks were moved.
    *   Ensure the active log is clean and contains only open items (and the empty `#### Done` headers are preserved or removed based on preference - *Default: Keep the header*).
