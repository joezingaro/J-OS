# Innovation Workshop - To-Do & Logistics
**Status:** Temporary / Self-Contained
**Goal:** Prepare for the 30-min Innovation Huddle (Miro vs. Hybrid).

1) Review slide deck (Maybe remove the 'goal card' -- keep it as a template in the PPT, and filling it out will be in Miro)
2) Insert slides into Miro for a more seamless experience
3) Put together speaking notes (Gemeni has these)
4) Update miro matrix to have axes middle justified
5) Dry Run


### Instructions to make the slide deck

This outlines the full slide deck based on our discussion. It includes the specific "Overview / Delivery / Features" structure you requested, the pivoted "15% as a Litmus Test" concept, and detailed speaker notes that cover both running the session and teaching the rationale.

This is designed to be your blueprint for the presentation.

## Slide Deck: Innovation Huddle for Organizational Leads

### Slide 1: Title Slide

*   **Title:** Innovation Huddle: From "Pain Points" to "Progress"
*   **Subtitle:** A collaborative session to spark creative ideas and define actionable innovation goals.
*   **Date:** 1/26/2026

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "Welcome everyone. Today is a dual-purpose session."
>
> "First, we are going to do the work. We are going to identify the friction in our days and turn it into actionable innovation goals for the upcoming year."
>
> "Second, I am handing you a toolkit. The framework we use today is something you can take back to your teams to surface their ideas and build a culture of continuous improvement."

### Slide 2: Objectives & Agenda

**Objectives:**
*   **Define Innovation:** Move beyond buzzwords to actionable definitions (Big I vs. Little i).
*   **Learn the System:** Master the "Innovation Loop" (Audit → Filter → Act).
*   **Draft a Goal:** Leave today with one clear, written Innovation Goal (PEP ready).

**Agenda:**
*   What does innovation look like?
*   The Frameworks: Deep dive into Rose, Thorn, Bud & The Litmus Test.
*   Interactive Exercise: Applying the frameworks in Miro.
*   Next Steps: Resources for you and your teams.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "Our primary goal is to leave here with something written down. Not just a vague idea, but a specific goal you can put in your performance plan."
>
> "To get there, we need to align on what innovation actually means for us—because it’s not just about inventing new products. It’s about fixing the work we do every day."

### Slide 3: What Does Innovation Look Like?

**Quote:** *"The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 'We've always done it this way.'"* — Grace Hopper

**The Definition:**
Innovation is the successful implementation of change that creates value. It is not limited to invention; it is about solving problems better than we did yesterday.

**The Spectrum:**

| Feature       | Big "I" Innovation (Strategic)   | Little "i" Innovation (Incremental) |
| :------------ | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Focus**     | Shifting Strategy & New Products | Fixing Processes & Freeing Capacity |
| **Driver**    | Leadership-led                   | Staff-led (Everyone)                |
| **Frequency** | Occasional (Quarterly/Yearly)    | Continuous (Daily/Weekly)           |
| **Goal**      | Growth                           | Efficiency & Sanity                 |

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> **The Quote:** "I start with this quote because innovation starts with a question: 'Why do we do it this way?'"
>
> **The Table:** "We often get paralyzed thinking we need 'Big I' innovation—massive strategic shifts—every day. We don't."
>
> **The Focus:** "Today, we are leaning heavily into 'Little i'. These are the process improvements that fix our daily friction. Why focus here? Because fixing the small stuff frees up the capacity we need to eventually tackle the big stuff."

### Slide 4: The Innovation Loop (The System)

**Visual:** A 3-Step Flow Chart

1.  **The Audit (Rose, Thorn, Bud):** Identify what is working and what is broken.
2.  **The Filter (Impact Matrix):** Prioritize based on Effort vs. Impact.
3.  **The Reality Check (15% Mindset):** Validate the goal by defining the first step.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "We are going to use three tools today. They work best when used in this specific order."
>
> "First, RTB helps us find the problems (The Audit)."
>
> "Second, the Matrix helps us separate the noise from the strategy (The Filter)."
>
> "Third, the 15% Solution ensures we aren't just wishing for change, but have a plan to start it (The Reality Check)."
>
> "This system moves us from 'Complaining' to 'Action' in about 45 minutes."

### Slide 5: Framework 1 – Rose, Thorn, Bud

**1. Framework Overview**
A retrospective tool used to audit current processes. It moves the team away from binary thinking ("Good vs. Bad") and into categorized thinking.

**2. Framework Delivery (The Sections)**
*   🌹 **Rose:** What is working well? (Strengths & Wins)
*   🌵 **Thorn:** What is painful or broken? (Friction & "Little i" opportunities)
*   🌱 **Bud:** What is a future opportunity? (Emerging ideas & "Big I" potential)

**3. Framework Features (Why it works)**
*   **Psychological Safety (The "Rose"):** We force positive feedback first to prevent a "gripe session." This lowers defenses so people feel safe sharing the negatives.
*   **Role Scalability (The "Thorn"):** Thorns scale with the user. A junior staff's Thorn is often "Little i" (broken task), while a VP's Thorn is often "Big I" (broken strategy).
*   **The Parking Lot (The "Bud"):** We separate "Buds" to keep dreamers from hijacking the meeting. It lets us focus on fixing the now (Thorns) without losing great ideas for the future.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "When we run this exercise, pay attention to the Thorns. Thorns are the fuel for innovation."
>
> "If you are running this with your own team, do not skip the Roses. It validates their hard work and makes them receptive to discussing the Thorns."
>
> "Also, use the Buds column aggressively. If someone starts pitching a massive 5-year plan while you're trying to fix a spreadsheet, put it in 'Buds' and get back to work. It’s your parking lot."

### Slide 6: Framework 2 – The Impact Matrix

**1. Framework Overview**
An adaptation of the Eisenhower Matrix used to prioritize our Thorns. It filters "Noise" from "Strategy."

**2. Framework Delivery (The Axes)**
*   **Y-Axis: Impact** (How much value does fixing this create?)
*   **X-Axis: Effort** (How hard is it to fix?)

**3. Framework Features (The Zones)**
*   **Top Left (High Impact / Low Effort):** Quick Wins. These are your "Little i" gold mines. Just do them.
*   **Top Right (High Impact / High Effort):** Major Projects. These are your strategic "Big I" PEP goals (e.g., Automation, New Systems).
*   **The Bottom Half:** Deprioritize. Do not waste innovation energy here.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "A list of Thorns is overwhelming. We need to filter them."
>
> "When we move to the Matrix, we are looking for the top half of the board."
>
> "Top Left are things you should just fix tomorrow. Top Right are the things that become your annual goals."

### Slide 7: Framework 3 – The 15% Solution

**1. Framework Overview**
A mindset shift that focuses on the 15% of control you have right now, rather than the 85% of constraints (budget, leadership, culture) you can't control.

**2. Framework Delivery (The Litmus Test)**
*   **The Question:** "What is the specific first step I can take tomorrow without asking for money or permission?"
*   **The Test:** If you cannot answer this question, you do not have a Goal—you have a Wish or a Dependency.

**3. Framework Features (Why it works)**
*   **Locus of Control:** It shifts the mindset from "Victim" (waiting for IT to fix it) to "Owner" (gathering data to build the case).
*   **Momentum:** Innovation dies when we wait for the "perfect time." This forces us to take imperfect action immediately.
*   **Goal Validation:** It ensures your PEP goal is actionable.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "This is the most important part of the day. We are using this as a Litmus Test for your goals."
>
> "If you say your goal is 'Fix the Software,' but you can't tell me what you are going to do about it tomorrow... that's not a goal. That's a wish."
>
> "But if you say, 'I will document the errors tomorrow to send to the vendor,' that is a 15% Solution. That is a valid goal."

### Slide 8: The Exercise (Miro Instructions)

**Phase 1: Warm Up (Roses & Buds)**
*   Get comfortable. Add wins and dreams. Clear the air.

**Phase 2: The Audit (Thorns)**
*   Go to your personal board. Dump every frustration. Be specific.

**Phase 3: The Filter (The Matrix)**
*   Move Thorns to the central Impact/Effort Matrix.
*   Cluster: Group similar Thorns together (e.g., "Reporting" issues).

**Phase 4: The Goal Card (Commitment)**
*   Pick ONE High Impact item (or cluster).
*   Complete the Goal Card to define your Innovation Goal and First Step.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "We are jumping into Miro now. I will guide you through each step."
>
> "We start with Roses/Buds to warm up. Then we get serious with Thorns."
>
> "By the end of this, I want everyone to have one filled-out Goal Card."

### Slide 9: The Goal Card Template

**1. The Thorn (The Problem):**
*   *Example:* Monthly reporting takes 8 hours of manual entry.

**2. The Innovation (The Goal):**
*   *What:* Automate data ingestion to reduce time by 50%.
*   *Context:* This becomes the title of your PEP Goal.

**3. The First Step (The 15% Litmus Test):**
*   *Action:* Tomorrow, I will list the exact data fields needed for the automation.
*   *Constraint:* Must be doable without budget or permission.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "This is your output. This is what you take back to your PEP."
>
> "Notice section 3. If you write 'Wait for budget,' try again. Find the step you own."

### Slide 10: Closing & Resources

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Balance:** Use RTB to validate the team (Roses) before asking for fixes (Thorns).
*   **Focus:** Use the Matrix to filter out low-value noise.
*   **Action:** Use the 15% Test to ensure goals are real.

> **Speaker Notes:**
>
> "You now have a draft goal. Please refine it and add it to your plan."
>
> "You also have this framework. I encourage you to run this with your teams—it’s the fastest way to find the 'Little i' innovations that will save your team time."
