#### Active

- (j1) [2026-01-25] **[IDEA]** Implement a "Daily Note" feature: auto-created daily, persistent shortcut launch, overlay access to history, always shows the full daily note contents in the popup (think quick capture, but with a full editor) and a forward/back button to go to previous or next day
- (j2) [2026-01-25] **[IDEA]** Develop a "Unified Task Sync" view: aggregates tasks from all sources, prioritizing urgent items with project filtering.
- (j3) [2026-01-25] **[IDEA]** Create an "Auto-Refactor" process for Daily Notes: parses text and moves items (e.g., meeting notes) to their respective attributes/files automatically.
- (j4) [2026-01-25] **[IDEA]** Create an "Endless Scroll" view for Daily Notes to browse history seamlessly.
- (j5) [2026-01-25] **[IDEA]** Develop a "Project View" dashboard: Left column for Meeting Note headlines, Right column for associated Tasks.
- (j6) [2026-01-25] **[IDEA]** Create "Brainstorming/Ideating" Docs: AI-assisted iteration from idea to outline/deliverable (distinct from meeting notes). For example, creating assets like 'build guides', or brainstorming a workshop.
- (j7) [2026-01-25] **[FEATURE]** Develop "Morning Routine" Workflow: Interactive session to groom tasks, identify stale/urgent items, review upcoming meetings, and launch the Daily Note.
- (j8) [2026-01-25] **[FEATURE]** Implement "Task Sync & Backlinking": Tasks created in notes/meetings sync to master logs with persistent IDs and back-links to source.
