## 2026-01-26: Team Huddle Innovation Exercise
**Context:** Reviewing the Innovation Exercise plan and strategy.

**Resources:**
*   [Innovation Exercise Note](../notes/2026-01-26_Innovation_Exercise.md)
*   [AI Workflow Summary](../notes/2026-01-26_Innovation_Exercise_AI_Workflow_Summary.html)

**AI Summary:**
*   **Key Action:** Joseph to develop a 30-60-90 day plan template for the new hire (interviewing top 3 candidates). (-> [Tracked](../work_log_2026.md))
*   **Strategy:** Repositioning "Innovation Committee" to "Innovation Group" or "Case Study Design"—using a specific project (Dolson watershed) as the first pilot rather than abstract committee work. (-> [Tracked](../work_log_2026.md))
*   **Education:** Planning a "Data Literacy" session (Excel/Systems thinking) before PowerBI rollout.
*   **Admin:** Joseph to track the Data Catalog and use it to identify PowerBI candidates. (-> [Tracked](../work_log_2026.md))

**Notes:**

### 1. Innovation Exercise Run-Through
*   **Timebox:** 40 minutes available.
*   **Support:** Joseph and Wassim can support if staff need help (especially GIS team who might be new to "whiteboard" style training).
*   **Context:** This is likely the first time this team has utilized a whiteboard/Miro style training. Might need extra hand-holding.
*   **Distribution:** Resources to be posted in Teams channel when ready.

### 2. Education Sessions Strategy
*   **PowerBI Rollout:**
    *   Clarification: Licenses are for "Personal Development" initially. Anyone can use desktop for training; publishing/web is restricted.
    *   Target Audience: Use the Data Catalog to identify users who would benefit.
*   **Pre-Requisite Training:**
    *   Proposal for an earlier "Data Literacy / Systems Thinking" session.
    *   Focus: Intelligent Excel setup and data structuring before moving to BI.
*   **Programming Schedule:**
    *   Diana to email the schedule.
    *   Action: Review this quarterly.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Every session needs a form: "Enjoyment rating," "What you liked," "Improvements," "Future topics."

### 3. Innovation Group
*   **Naming:** Moving away from "Committee."
*   **Structure:** Core group + rotating staff brought in to build specific "Business Cases."
*   **First Case Study:** Dolson Watershed project.
    *   *Strategy:* Don't take over their work; tap into their knowledge to solve an org challenge.
*   **Function:** Group can also lead training sessions.

### 4. New Hire (Coordinator)
*   **Status:** Interviewing 5 people -> narrow to Top 3 for Diana -> Top 2 for final.
*   **Onboarding:** Create a **30-60-90 Day Plan**. (-> [Tracked](../work_log_2026.md))
*   **Tooling:** Develop a reusable MS Planner template for onboarding that is transferrable to other teams. (-> [Tracked](../work_log_2026.md))

### 5. Data Governance
*   **Data Catalog:** Joseph to track and follow. Use this to scout for PowerBI potential users. (-> [Tracked](../work_log_2026.md))
