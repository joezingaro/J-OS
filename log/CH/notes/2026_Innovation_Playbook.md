# 🚀 Innovation Playbook for Leads (2026 Edition)
**"Practical Tools for Your PEP"**

> **The Goal:** Empower leads to identify their own innovation ideas, and give them a way to do the same with their teams. This guide provides a framework you can use to identify, define, and execute innovation goals for your 2026 PEP.

## 1. The Strategy: "Full Spectrum" Innovation
Innovation Most teams get stuck because they think "Innovation" only means massive, scary change. We need to normalize both ends of the spectrum.

### 🐣 "Little i" Innovation (Process)
*   **What is it?** Removing friction. Saving 10 minutes a day. Fixing a broken form.
*   **The Vibe:** "Quick Wins," "Sanity Savers."
*   **PEP Goal Example:** *"Digitize the intake log to save 2 hours/week of manual entry."*

### 🦖 "Big I" Innovation (Transformation)
*   **What is it?** New capabilities. Structural change. Adopting AI.
*   **The Vibe:** "Strategic Bets," "Game Cangers."
*   **PEP Goal Example:** *"Pilot an AI-driven workflow for the Q4 reporting cycle."*

> **Your 2026 PEP Portfolio:** Aim for **2 Quick Wins** (to build momentum) and **1 Strategic Bet** (for career growth).

## 2. The Diagnostic: "Rose, Thorn, Bud"
Don't ask your team "How can we innovate?" (That causes brain freeze). Instead, map your reality:

| Symbol      | Concept         | The Innovation Trigger                                                     |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌹 **Rose**  | **Successes**   | What’s working well? (Celebrate this, don't change it).                    |
| 🌵 **Thorn** | **Pain Points** | What is broken/slow/annoying? **(This is your "Little i" list).**          |
| 🌱 **Bud**   | **Potential**   | What is a promising idea that needs help? **(This is your "Big I" list).** |

## 3. The Action: "15% Solutions"
When you hit a "Thorn" that feels too big (e.g., "We need a new $300k ERP system"), don't freeze. Use the **15% Solution** rule.

*   **The Trap:** Focusing on the **85%** that requires approvals, budget, or other departments.
*   **The Unlock:** Focusing on the **15%** that falls within your direct **Sphere of Influence**.
*   **The Shift:**
    *   *From:* "We can't fix the ERP."
    *   *To:* "I can clean our data columns so we are ready when the ERP comes."

## 4. The Innovation Menu: 5 Micro-Habits
Small changes to team rhythm that signal "Innovation is safe here."

### 1️⃣ The Friday Fail Share
*   **The Habit:** Spend 5 minutes on Friday sharing one small thing that *didn't* work.
*   **The Why:** Removes the fear of failure. If leaders admit mistakes, staff will attempt new things.

### 2️⃣ The "No-Meeting" Afternoon
*   **The Habit:** Designate one afternoon (e.g., Thursday 1pm-4pm) as deep-work time.
*   **The Why:** Innovation requires focus. Constant context-switching kills creative thought.

### 3️⃣ The 10-Minute Demo
*   **The Habit:** End your weekly sync with a show-and-tell. "Who built/fixed something this week?"
*   **The Why:** Celebrates "makers" and makes hidden work visible.

### 4️⃣ The 3-Question Retro
*   **The Habit:** Once a month, ask: *What should we Start? What should we Stop? What should we Continue?*
*   **The Why:** Continuously prunes dead processes ("Stop") to make room for new ones ("Start").

### 5️⃣ Video Updates (Teams)
*   **The Habit:** Replace one long email per week with a 90-second screen recording.
*   **The Why:** Higher fidelity, more human, and often faster than typing perfect prose.

## 5. Facilitation Guide: Running Your Own Session
Want to run the **"Impact vs Effort"** exercise with your team? Here is the 30-minute agenda.

1.  **Brain Dump (7 mins):**
    *   Ask: *"What were the top THORNS (pain points) of 2025?"*
    *   Action: Everyone writes 1 idea per sticky note.
2.  **The Matrix (10 mins):**
    *   Draw a generic X/Y graph: **Effort** (Low to High) vs **Impact** (Low to High).
    *   Drag stickies onto the map.
3.  **The Selection (8 mins):**
    *   Identify the **Quick Wins** (High Impact, Low Effort). Grab these first!
    *   Identify one **Major Project** (High Impact, High Effort).
    *   Delete the **Wasted Effort** (Low Impact, High Effort).
4.  **The Commitment (5 mins):**
    *   Assign names to the winners. These become draft PEP goals.
