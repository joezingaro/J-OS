## 📥 Inbox / Unsorted
*(For quick dumps when you don't have time to specify a project)*
- (w23) [2026-01-22] **[IDEA]** Beef up the work log. Introduce 'pipes' or 'flags' that can also help turn this into a table/visualize it.


## ⏱️ Project: Time Tracking for WMSS
*(Backlog and investigation notes)*
- (w21) [2026-01-22] **[TOVALIDATE]** List of projects, especially the 3 levels of filtering ("Levels" to be generic)
- (w24) [2026-01-22] **[TASK]** Create a form/email for BIDS so that WMSS time tracking issues/bugs/features/enhancements can be sent to us
- (w37) [2026-01-22] **[TOVALIDATE]** With Krystyna, validate that projects aren't added often (Supporting the 'on demand' refresh idea)
- (w43) [2026-01-23] **[TOVALIDATE]** if the teams think their staff would benefit from a session with me
- (w44) [2026-01-23] **[TASK]** Create a 'person' list
- (w45) [2026-01-23] **[TASK]** Test full process of linking Excel -> Project LIst -> Person List -> And then can start PBI Dev
- (w49) [2026-01-23] **[TOVALIDATE]** Should there be similar names in planning & restoration and science? Maybe not our problem to solve now?

#### Some Known Issues
- (w46) [2026-01-23] **[NOTE]** Recognizing that a lot of flexibility has been built in to manage some items centrally -- but we are still dealing with 50 files, and there's still a chance something happens we didn't account for and we need to make updates. The solve/pro is -- we can use an application we have called Power Automate and have it update all files for us.
- (w47) [2026-01-23] **[NOTE]** Have done immense testing, ideally we have a chance to let a small group of users have it for a week or two before everyone gets it. If they can enter their January data, we can have it tested and rolled out 2nd week of Feb, still a chance something happens. Mitigation is I will reserve time for this work to help correct any issues that come up.

#### Training
- (w51) [2026-01-23] **[NOTE]** There has to be less flexibility for data entry -- so it's good quality data on data ingestion. Still feel like this is flexible, but should not alter the strucutre of workbooks with control X, and don't delete rows or columns. Copying and ddeleting is safer, or letting us know you need an edit and we can show you how to do it safely

    - (w48) [2026-01-23] **[FEATURE]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Critical components of workbook are locked down to prevent accidental editing, so the risk of causing a workbook error is pretty low (Just don't cut and paste!)~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
    - (w50) [2026-01-23] **[FEATURE]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Add in a 'last refreshed' indicator so it's more obvious when you refresh that it finished.~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- **[TASK]**
    - (w4) [2026-01-21] **[TASK]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~If someone adds data (hours) into a row with no project, the whole row gets highlighted as red (And a future iteration - may be able to add a condition message as well, but only if possible with no VBA)~~ (Completed: 2026-01-22) (Update: Added data validation that combines two rules, a) The input must be a number between 0 and 24, and b) there must be a 'project' selected in that row)
    - (w11) [2026-01-21] **[TASK]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Lock town/protect parts of worksheet so Staff can't accidentally muck it up~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)

    - (w35) [2026-01-22] **[TASK]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Turn off auto-update of connection~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23; Reason: Projects don't change often, and this might cause some 'credential' issues depending on how users have opened it. Will add 'how to refresh' instructions, which will include 'be on a CH network device')
- **[BUG]**
    - (w25) [2026-01-22] **[BUG]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Have to fix department, right now validation doesn't allow the & symbol to show up~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
    - (w26) [2026-01-22] **[BUG]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Look into different wayt for updating the list, to try and avoid the credential pop up~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)

    - (w30) [2026-01-22] **[IDEA]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Include what can be edited (formatting) and what can't be and why~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
    - (w31) [2026-01-22] **[IDEA]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Include where to go for issues (A form we can make to log bugs/support) and Krystyna and BIDS as contact~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
    - (w32) [2026-01-22] **[IDEA]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~"Do not use cut/paste, use copy/paste values if you need to, but ideally delete and re-enter"~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
    - (w33) [2026-01-22] **[IDEA]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~How to restore a version on SharePoint if you mess something up~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
    - (w36) [2026-01-22] **[IDEA]** ✅ **[DONE]** ~~Add something for 'how to refresh'~~ (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- **[NOTE]**
    - (w10) [2026-01-21] **[DONE]** ~~Users can adjust any formatting they want (Can colour rows) -- but do not edit~~ (Completed: 2026-01-22; Note: The workbook is built so formatting makes no difference. Still ideally people do minimal changes.)
    - (w34) [2026-01-22] **[NOTE]** ~~Flexible but high integrity design -> Multiple decisions so we can make updates to key components in one place (SharePoint) and it propogates into each workbook for staff, minmizing our need to ever open up workbooks going forward~~ (Completed: 2026-01-22)
- **[CANCELLED]**
    - (w3) [2026-01-21] **[FEATURE]** ❌ **[CANCELLED]** ~~Warning message in addition to visual indicator (Yellow highlight) for duplicate projects~~ (Cancelled: 2026-01-21; Reason: No way to add a warning message without VBA. We COULD add a 'status' column in 'B' that adds text for duplicates. Best handled though in the instructions sheet.)
    - (w7) [2026-01-21] **[CANCELLED]** ~~Highlight/warn when numbers are incorrect based on a custom WEEK limit?~~ (Cancelled: 2026-01-22; Reason: We can do this much more easily in PBI, and the 'daily limit' for users should be enough to find situations where weeks are off.)
    - (w9) [2026-01-21] **[CANCELLED]** ~~Add in a 'summary' sheet that groups by month, using no formulas/macros~~ (Cancelled: 2026-01-22; Reason: This is reporting, and I am going to keep this in PowerBI, so the workbook stays exclusively as data entry.)
