- [ ] [2026-01-25 13:31] **[INBOX]** Idea: Make an app for pop cuiture references (or online tweet references)
- [ ] [2026-01-26 10:19] **[INBOX]** Message Krystyna to reschedule the Manager WMSS Call
- [ ] [2026-01-26 13:35] **[INBOX]** Remember -- Wassim's idea re: Innovation Committee
- [ ] [2026-01-26 13:36] **[INBOX]** Innovation Group -> Case Study design, so we can show what we can do (PEople will want to solve by themselves) -- maybe this committee can be a 'case stdy' and also be used to help solve org challenges via innovation
- [ ] [2026-01-26 16:36] **[INBOX]** Need to look into plugins to make markdown easier to read. The preview is annoying and not live as far as I can tell.
- [ ] [2026-01-26 16:37] **[INBOX]** Bug in the quick capture to fix -- if we go to extra line, the line goes up and disappears. I think the editor should grow with the text, so if I write 20 lines it gets 20 lines long (And since we're docked on the bottom it has to grow 'up')
- [ ] [2026-01-26 20:35] **[INBOX]** Go through programs and start deleting them (Linear, Notion, Capacities - use disk size exploer to help find them)
- [ ] [2026-01-26 23:18] **[INBOX]** Look into 'brand images' with marCom -- I think we can create a spot where people can immediately grab approved images.
- [ ] [2026-01-27 00:34] **[INBOX]** Respond back to that Amanda T thread -- it was from a while ago, but keep it in the loop.
- [ ] [2026-01-27 00:34] **[INBOX]** Double check if there was anything form Winston taht seemed important to follow up on
- [ ] [2026-01-27 00:34] **[INBOX]** Review that park pass project -- check with Richard again on dates, check with Diana on it being a bigger innovation
- [ ] [2026-01-27 23:18] **[INBOX]** Create a workflow that I can use to log work I've completed when a project finishes? And have some standard questions/form based, who it was for... summary.. timeline... what it did... what $ it saved... etc
